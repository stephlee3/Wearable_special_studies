# Wearable_speical_studies

The goal of this project is to analyze high-dimensional wearable data(specifically, NHANES data) from advanced special topics course. In the first part, we build a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model to characterize the excessive zeros in PA profiles. In the second part, we develop a function-on-scalar regression model to explore how the patterns of activity count change with BMI.
